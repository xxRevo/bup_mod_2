The massive dust clouds makes it impossible to continue normal daily functions properly as roads are closed, infrastructure and agriculture is damaged and the unprepared federal government is scrambling to respond in anyway."
 USA_pitsburg_flood_desc:0 "14 meters of flood levels peaked in the city of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Hundreds of thousands of buildings are destroyed, steel mills are out of commission, roads are ruined, railroads are washed away, electricity is out and about a total of quarter billion dollars in damage has crippled the state. The government are trying their best to respond to this disaster, but it will be weeks or even months before the city is accessible again."

 sealion_score_modifier_spirit_desc:0 "As a precondition for Unternehmen Seelöwe, Hitler specified the achievement of both air and naval superiority over the English Channel and the proposed landing sites, but the German forces did not achieve either at any point during the war. Nevertheless, both the German Army and Navy undertook a major programme of preparations for an invasion: training troops, developing specialised weapons and equipment, and modifying transport vessels. A large number of river barges and transport ships were gathered together on the Channel coast, but with Luftwaffe losses mounting in the Battle of Britain and no sign that the Royal Navy had been defeated, Hitler postponed Sea Lion indefinitely on 17 September 1940; it was never put into action."
