Hundreds of thousands of buildings are destroyed, steel mills are out of commission, roads are ruined, railroads are washed away, electricity is out and about a total of quarter billion dollars in damage has crippled the state. The government are trying their best to respond to this disaster, but it will be weeks or even months before the city is accessible again."
